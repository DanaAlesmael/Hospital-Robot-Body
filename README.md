# Hospital-Robot-Body

The main focuses when designing a wheeled robot to use in hospitals were:
* Secure all components that will be placed inside the robot by using a slide-like door at the back. 
* Since the purpose of this robot was to provide a good/ fast treatment and help connecting patients with doctors, the design was kept simple with an attached symbol in the front side as an indicator for Hospital-Robot. Red lights were included to take ambulance's role when dealing with patients. 
* The company's name (Smart methods/ الأساليب الذكيه ) was included to give the work a credit.
