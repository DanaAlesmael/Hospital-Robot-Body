# Hospital-Robot-Body

The main focuses when designing a wheeled robot to use in hospitals were:
* Secure all items that will be placed inside the robot by using a slide-like door at the back which can be fixed using a specific type of hinge. The hinge was designed depending on boole technique and was placed on the lower and upper parts of the door. 
* Since the purpose of this robot was to provide a good/ fast treatment and help connecting patients with doctors, the design was kept simple with an attached symbol in the front side as an indicator for Hospital-Robot; The icon was taken from an open source file with simple modifications such as adding spaces for screwa to attach the icon to the robot's body. The body was built using a cube object and traper was applied to make the upper part smaller.  
* Red lights were also included to take ambulance's role when dealing with patients as it would be helpful in case of night video calls where not a lot of lights available. Its main feaure is they are removeable because they should be attached using a small wire.
* The company's name (Smart methods) was included to give the work a credit. Boole techniques was also applies so that the company's name can be attached directly without the need of using screws. 
* The body was decorated on the sides to give the robot better appearance. These decorations can be placed on the robot using screws, as a three holes on each sides were created. 
* The part where the robot's wheels should be attached to was kept the same as in the original design to save time and to focus more on the body's design. 



* ScreenShots files represent the original design as followed in my hand sketch design. However, similar ideas came to my mind while designing. For example, using an open source medical icon instead of doing it from scratch would not only save time but also enhance the robot's quality.   
* Some files were compressed (as Zip file) due to their large size. [Example of these files are: IconF.stl and HospitalAll.stl].
