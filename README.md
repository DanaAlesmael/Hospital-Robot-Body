# Hospital-Robot-Body

The main focuses when designing a wheeled robot to use in hospitals were:
* Secure all components that will be placed inside the robot by using a slide-like door at the back which can be fixed using a hinge on its side. 
* Since the robot would be used in hospitals, its body was kept formal with less shapes applied to it. To illustrate, the body was built using a cube object and traper was applied to make the upper part smaller.  
* Since the purpose of this robot was to provide a good/ fast treatment and help connecting patients with doctors, the design was kept simple with an attached symbol in the front side as an indicator for Hospital-Robot. Red lights were included to take ambulance's role when dealing with patients as it would be helpful in case of night video calls where not a lot of lights available. 
* The company's name (Smart methods/ الأساليب الذكيه ) was included to give the work a credit.
* The body was decorated on the sides to give the robot better appearance.
* The part where the robot's wheels should be attached to was kept the same as in the original design to save time and to focus more on the body's design.
